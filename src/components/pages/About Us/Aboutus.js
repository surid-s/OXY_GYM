      <h1 className="about">Our team is all over the world.</h1>
      <p className="about-p">What started out as a single gym filled with homemade equipment has grown into a global brand on the cutting edge of fitness. World Gym aims to give its members the very best: from modern equipment, to a clean and welcoming atmosphere with an expert staff.

        Amenities vary by location, but often include superior strength equipment, tons of cardio with TVs, group classes such as spin, yoga, kickboxing, and boot camp, personal training and nutritional counseling, and much more. In addition, many locations feature basketball and tennis courts, swimming pools, mixed martial arts studios, saunas, and more. Whether you're a weekend warrior or a pro athlete, we are the ultimate fitness destination.
        <br />

        We're also excited to announce the launch of World Gym Athletics, our exclusive, studio-style, small group training program that combines the best of HIIT, Olympic Lifting and functional training. World Gym Athletics is available now at select gyms.</p>
